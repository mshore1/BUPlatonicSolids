Normal Builder works like this:
	Button clicked -> Node.cs Instantiate()'s a Node at the position of Spawner, which is permanently parented to the Camera.

How AutoBuilder would work:
public void Button() {
	SpawnManager spawner;
	File f_points = open("points.txt");
	String nextCoord_str = f_points.readline()
	while( nextCoord_str != "" ){
		Vector3 nextCoord = str2vec3( nextCoord_str );
		spawner.SetPos(nextCoord);
		spawner.SpawnNode();
	}
}
