Hi Platonics, this is Robert, you can push and clone by making a personal access token (github profile icon > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Token > Generate (just check All repo). Then copy it and save it somewhere, and paste it in place of your password whenever prompted, for example while doing git push -u origin develop. That's not a very good explanation I guess
